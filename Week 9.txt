Deployment backend in internet 
CD continous deployment
front end deplymnet vercel netlify - easy
backend - difficult

pre CICI - aws axure lets u buys server online i.e. simple machine with one special featue.
public IP is the feature it has

http://ec2-3-106-121-245.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/

pre CICI - no automatic deployment, 
i.e. when u push to girtub u also pull yout code from the server
and then push to the server 

public ip are limited its is how u identiyf your server / vERY SIMILAR TO DOMin name

Dumb way to deploy

              (Random imp points abt the steps above ^^ )
> look for ipv4 dns - ec2-16-171-171-39.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
> if anyone hits this url they can see what i want
> ipv4 ADDRESS Via u can use as ip address vis port 80 and get to my server

> port are a way ro identify a process on a machine
> are are various ports on server its not phisical concept
